This is a web application built using React and MongoDB to help hospitals efficiently manage and deliver meals to patients. The main goal is to keep track of which meals are delivered to each patient and to generate personalized meal plans based on the dietary requirements provided by doctors.

What This Project Does

Generates meal plans for each patient—morning, afternoon, and evening—based on their medical condition and doctor's recommendations.

Tracks food delivery to make sure patients receive the right meals at the right time.

Allows doctors to specify dietary restrictions (like diabetic-friendly, low sodium, high-protein, etc.).

Keeps logs of all deliveries and meal plans for easy reference.

Integration with hospital record systems
